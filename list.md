Restricted terms in ML-tools

Midjourney strives to generate only PG-13 images, which is why certain prompts relating to violence, gore, harassment, drugs, adult content, & generally offensive topics are restricted. Same goes for the still in beta Adobe Firefly.
The banned terms are under constant revision & not public, so I'm going to list the words & groups, that I hit:

# Midjourney
- ass
- bare 
- breast (chest is allowed)
- cannibal
- medical horror
- organs 
- Ouija (dafuqâ€½)
- Rule34
- takes a shower
- vein
- willy

## Not restricted anymore
- blood


# Firefly
- Berlin (dafuq) 
- blood
- bloodstream 
- crimson
